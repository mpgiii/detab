**detab**

a program which takes in a text file
as an input (through stdio.h) and outputs a new
file which has replaced tabs with spaces.
This program assumes the size of a tab in an
editor to be up to 8 spaces and adds spaces
accordingly. This can be changed by changing
the definition of TAB size at the top of this
file.
