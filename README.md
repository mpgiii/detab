# detab

TO FUTURE STUDENTS: Please do not take this code and upload
it as your own. The professors know you're doing this and it
only hurts you. This is an easy project so it would
be silly to copy this.

--

a program which takes in a text file
as an input (through stdio.h) and outputs a new
file which has replaced tabs with spaces.
This program assumes the size of a tab in an
editor to be up to 8 spaces and adds spaces
accordingly. This can be changed by changing
the definition of TAB size at the top of this
file.
